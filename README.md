# Drop-in Web Components

## What are drop-in web components?

Drop-in web components are simple, declarative, hosted web components that you can add to your website without writing any code.

## What are drop-in web components?

Drop-in web components differ from the *W3C Working Group* draft specification for web components in many ways.

They are backwards-compatible with *HTML5* without a polyfill, and are not meant to be a replacement for the web components specification.

Also, it is difficult to predict when and how the web components specification will be adopted, as the *draft specification* was mostly rejected by *Microsoft* & *Mozilla*.

## How does it work?

Most components will contain demos and a snippet of code to paste onto your website. There are no other dependencies.

## Getting Started

Include the following script in your page

`<script src="http://wpages.co/components/library/loader.js"></script>`  
    
Then, you will be able to load a component from the component server.

## Contributing

Component authors can submits a pull-request, and add their components to this repository.

This can be as simple as a wrapper for an existing jQuery library, or a completely original work.
